# 0.6V-W-Power-Four-Stage-OTA-with-Minimal-Components
This repository presents the design and simulation of a 0.6 V, ultra-low power four-stage Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology. The design focuses on achieving stable operation at low supply voltage with minimal components while supporting a wide load range.  
The project is implemented and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso, and performance is evaluated in terms of gain, phase margin, noise, CMRR, and PSRR.
